# HWComponents-ADC
HWComponents-ADC provides estimates for the area and energy of Analog-Digital Converters
(ADCs) for use in analog & mixed-signal accelerator design space exploration.

Models are based on statistical analysis of published ADC performance data in Boris
Murmann's ADC Performance Survey [1]. The energy model is based on the observation that
the maximum efficiency of an ADC is bounded by the sampling rate and the resolution [1],
and the area model is based on regression analysis. Estimations are optimistic; they
answer the question "what is the best possible ADC design for the given parameters?".

## Installation
Clone the repository and install with pip:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Accelergy-Project/hwcomponents-adc.git
cd hwcomponents-adc
pip install .

# Check that the installation is successful
hwc --list | grep ADC
```

## Usage
### Inerface

This estimator introduces the ADC estimator. ADC estimators can be instantiated with the
following parameters:
- `n_bits`: the resolution of the ADC
- `tech_node`: the technology node in meters
- `n_adcs`: the number of ADCs working together, in the case of alternating
  ADCs
- `throughput`: the aggregate throughput of the ADCs, in samples per second

ADCs support the following actions:
- `read` or `convert`: Convert a single value from analog to digital. Note: if
  there are multiple ADCs, this is a single conversion from a single ADC.

### Exploring Tradeoffs
There are several tradeoffs available around ADC design:
- Lower-resolution ADCs are smaller and more energy-efficient.
- Using more ADCs in parallel allows for a lower frequency, but increases the
  area.
- Using fewer ADCs in parallel allows for a higher frequency. Up to a point,
  this will not increase the area or energy/area of the ADCs. However, at some
  this will result in an exponential increase in energy/area.
- Lower-resolution ADCs can run at higher frequencies before the exponential
  increase in energy/area occurs.

When the HWComponents-ADC runs, it will output a list of alternative design options.
Each will report a number of ADCs and frequency needed to achieve the desired
throughput, as well as the area and energy of the ADCs. You can then use this
information to make tradeoffs between ADC resolution, frequency, and number of
ADCs.

HWComponents-ADC is the work of Tanner Andrulis & Ruicong Chen.

## Updating the ADC Model
The generated ADC model is based on the data in Boris Murmann's survey [1],
included in the submodule. This survey is updated periodically. The model can
be update to reflect the most recent data by running the following:

```bash
pip3 install scikit-learn
pip3 install pandas
pip3 install numpy
git submodule update --init --recursive --remote
python3 update_model.py
```

This is only necessary if more recent data is published. If the data here is
out of date, please open an issue or pull request.
